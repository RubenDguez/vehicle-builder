# Vehicle Builder

![](static/demo.gif)

## Description
Vehicle Builder is a command-line application that allows users to create, select, and interact with different types of vehicles. Users can choose to create a new vehicle or select an existing one, provide details about the vehicle, and then perform various actions with it. The application supports three types of vehicles: cars, trucks, and motorbikes, and it offers a user-friendly interface for managing and interacting with these vehicles through a series of prompts and commands.

- Project Motivation: The motivation behind this project is to create a simple yet functional command-line application that demonstrates the basics of user input handling, object-oriented programming, and interaction within a console environment. This project is designed to help developers improve their understanding of these fundamental programming concepts while working on a practical and engaging application.
- Why Build This Project? Building this project provides an opportunity to practice and apply essential programming skills in a real-world scenario. It allows developers to:
    1. Gain experience in designing and implementing a command-line interface.
    2. Learn how to handle user input and provide feedback through the console.
    3. Understand the principles of object-oriented programming by creating and managing different types of vehicles.
    4. Develop problem-solving skills by implementing various actions and interactions for the vehicles.
- Problem Solved: This project addresses the need for a simple and interactive way to manage and interact with virtual vehicles. It provides a structured approach to creating, selecting, and using different types of vehicles, making it easier for users to understand and interact with the application. The project also helps developers overcome common challenges associated with handling user input, managing objects, and providing feedback in a command-line environment.
- What Was Learned: Through this project, developers can learn and reinforce several important concepts and skills: 
    1. User Input Handling: How to prompt users for input, validate the input, and respond appropriately.
    2. Object-Oriented Programming: Creating and managing different vehicle classes with properties and methods.
    3. Command-Line Interface Design: Structuring a console application to be user-friendly and intuitive.
    4. Problem-Solving: Developing and implementing actions for the vehicles, handling edge cases, and providing meaningful feedback to the user.
    5. Software Development Process: Planning, designing, coding, testing, and debugging a complete application.
